    1. What's your approach to executing the CLI script in a high availability and scalability scenario?
    2. How do you develop a Dockerfile to execute the CLI script? ( Assume that you can use `php:cli` as the base image)
    3. How do you automate the above docker container to run each minute?
----------------------------------
## Task 2

    3. How do you improve your terraform module to grant SSH access and HTTP access?
    4. What's your approach to automating Jenkins and relevant dependencies installation on the EC2 instance?
----------------------------------
## Task 3

Web application released as a docker image, and it requires nginx,pgsql as dependency containers.

    1. How do you deploy the above three containers in the Kubernetes cluster?
    2. If we need to scale the nginx container based on demand how do you achieve it?
